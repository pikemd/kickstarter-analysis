# Kickstarter-Analysis

## This project is an analysis to determine theater outcomes vs launch dates, as well as determining the percentages funded based on goals set through Kickstarter campaigns.

### The purpose of this was to determine information on theater campaigns in kickstart and which ones are the most successful based on the launch date and their goals.

## The challenges was determining which was the best way to present the data. Descending order so you can see the months which did the best quickly and easily or show it in chronological order, because that makes more sense to try to find a certain month quickly.

### Based on the launch date it does appear that plays in the US were more successful in the months of April and May. 

### The goals for the successful plays in the US had an average amount of about $5000.

### Difficulties and challenges I have encored is working with figuring out how to separate the categories into two different categories so I could more easily get through the data.

## Results

- Two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that May is the best timeframe seems to be the best time to get a successful campaign, it also does come with a higher likely to be failed. You are most likely to be successful if you are doing something between $0-$5000. You are very likely to fail if you fall into the $45,000 to $49,999 range.

- The limitations with this data set is it is only using information from Kickstarter. There are many other methods and ways you could go about trying to get theater funded. Based on the information we do not know if it was for production, costumes, or other elements to do with theater which may be skewing the data set.

- Based on the data we have we could also create tables that show which country had the most successful, the average backers count per play, and what the average donation was.

-Images about the dataset have been attached as resources.
