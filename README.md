# kickstarter-analysis

## The poject was to determine information related to sucessful and failed US kick starters related to plays.

### The purpose of this was to determine difference in goals verses pledges on Play kickstarters in the US.

## The challenges and anaylsis on this was to seperate out the category down strictly to just plays.

### Based on the launch date it does appear that plays in the US were more successful in the months of April and May. 

### The goals for the sucessful plays in the US had an average amount of about $5000 which was about half of the amount requested for the failed plays in the US.

### Difficulties and challenges I have encourted is working with quartiles.

## The plays in the us that are sucessful are normally about $5ooo and the ones that are about $10,000 tend to be less successful. The average donation on a sucessful US play kickstarter champian is baout $90 something dollars. 

- Two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that May is the best timeframe seems to be the best time to get a succesful champain. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
